Always use node pointer variables (LL_Node* node) in your program. Copying a node to a non-pointer variable (LL_Node node = *LL_NodeCreate()) creates a node that is disconnected from the linked list.
DO NOT EVER set any node's data to stack allocated memory. Either allocate memory yourself or use the library functions (recommended)
Don't forget the first node's pointer. Some functions may require it.
